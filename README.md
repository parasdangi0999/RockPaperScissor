# RockPaperScissors on Algorand üéÆü§ñ

## Project Description

Welcome to **RockPaperScissors**, a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Algorand blockchain! This project implements the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors as a smart contract, allowing two players to compete fairly and transparently without trusting a central authority. The game logic runs securely on Algorand‚Äôs blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof results and instant verification.

---

## What It Does

This dApp lets two players submit their choices ‚Äî Rock, Paper, or Scissors ‚Äî to the blockchain. The smart contract then evaluates the inputs, determines the winner, and stores the results on-chain. Because everything runs on Algorand, the gameplay is fast, secure, and trustless.

---

## Features

- **On-chain Game Logic**: All choices and results are managed by the Algorand smart contract.
- **Fair and Transparent**: No player can cheat or manipulate the outcome.
- **Simple Inputs**: Players choose between Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2).
- **Instant Winner Calculation**: The contract determines if Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, or if it‚Äôs a draw.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Uses Algorand‚Äôs GlobalState for storing player choices.

## How It Works (Code Overview)

```typescript
import { Contract, GlobalState, uint64 } from '@algorandfoundation/algorand-typescript'

export class RockPaperScissors extends Contract {
  // 0 = Rock, 1 = Paper, 2 = Scissors
  p1Choice = GlobalState<uint64>({ key: "p1", initialValue: 0 })
  p2Choice = GlobalState<uint64>({ key: "p2", initialValue: 0 })

  setChoices(p1: uint64, p2: uint64): string {
    this.p1Choice.value = p1
    this.p2Choice.value = p2

    if (p1 === p2) return "draw"
    if ((p1 === 0 && p2 === 2) || (p1 === 1 && p2 === 0) || (p1 === 2 && p2 === 1)) return "p1 wins"
    return "p2 wins"
  }
}
````

* Players submit their choices as numbers (0, 1, or 2).
* The smart contract compares these and returns the game outcome.

## Getting Started

To try it yourself, clone the repo and deploy the contract using the Algorand developer tools. Make sure you have Node.js and Algorand SDK installed.
